# FIXER

**INACTIVE NOTICE: This theme is unsupported by WPMUDEV, we've published it here for those technical types who might want to fork and maintain it for their needs.**

A flat and vibrant WordPress tradesman’s theme for selling your services and standing out from the crowd. Fixer is big, bold and demands to be seen - giving your business the visibility it deserves.

## Fixer is an excellent choice for promoting your trade and building trust in your brand – whether you’re the butcher, the baker, or the candlestick maker.

## Colorful One-Page Layout

Show off your business on a single, scrollable page and choose colors that fit your brand.

Add as many or as few sections as you need for your services, and promote your work with fetching photography and eye-catching calls to action.

## Wall-to-Wall Mega Slider

You won’t be able to look away from the wall-to-wall mega slider, which makes full use of Fixer’s responsive design.

The built-in action buttons will quickly direct users to specific areas of your site.

## Fantastically Flat Features

Bold blocky design extends to a sortable gallery and custom page templates for your portfolio, blog, about and contact pages.

Fixer’s clear “Get a Quote” template will have you winning over new clients in no time.

## Big Friendly Raleway, Small Friendly Raleway

Top level headings in Fixer display a super-chunky variation of the elegant sans-serif typeface Raleway.

Grab attention fast while providing a much-needed contrast to Fixer’s otherwise right-angled style.

Paragraphs use the original Raleway, making for a sleek, minimalist look with lots of character.

## Have Something To Sell?

Fixer comes packaged with MarketPress and WooCommerce elements styled for you.

Set up a slick and stylish online store in minutes without a single line of code.


## Fanfare or Faded

By default Fixer ships with some seriously eye-popping color schemes. Want to tone it down? Just nudge the global color scheme and choose your own images to match.

## CUSTOMIZATION

Take complete control over colors, fonts, styles, images, videos and content - in just a few clicks.

## RESPONSIVE
